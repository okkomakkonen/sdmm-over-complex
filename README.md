# SDMM over complex numbers

This script generates the data for comparing the security and numerical accuracy of SDMM schemes over the complex numbers. The notation used mostly matches the notation in the paper.

Install the dependencies with

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The script `plot.py` generates a plot based on the parameters described in the document. It can be run with

```bash
python plot.py
```

This generates the plot as `plot.eps` in the root folder.

The `plots/` folder contains the plots from the paper.
